The primary purpose of assessment and evaluation is to improve student learning.
Information gathered through assessment helps teachers to determine studentsâ€™ strengths and weaknesses in their achievement of the curriculum expectations.
Evaluation refers to the process of judging the quality of student work on the basis of established criteria, and assigning a value to represent that quality.
Assessments and evaluations are varied in nature, administered over a period of time, and designed to provide opportunities for students to demonstrate the full range of their learning.
All assessments and evaluations will be related to the learning activities used, correspond to the purposes of instruction, match the needs and experiences of the students, and be fair to all students.
As they are enrolled in a University Preparation level course, students of MCR3U can expect a majority of evaluations to be in test form.
Test in this instance refers to evaluative tools designed to assess the pupils' ability to think mathematically and to explain their thinking, with an emphasis on 'explaining why', rather than just 'knowing how'.
